            <p>
                Our starting concept was rather straightforward and easy to grasp: utilizing compass technology to
                connect two individuals remotely. Picture mobilily being alerted when you and another user you know were
                facing your devices towards each other. This idea fits the criteria of maintaining connections between
                users whilst physical distance separates them. However, as we expressed our concept, much critical
                reception was given to the idea, namely its similarity to other services.
                <img src="https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/348572-image/P1470466.jpg">
                After some digging around, our group defined Snapchat's friend compass as a similar service to our own.
                To set our idea apart, we decided to infuse an element of gamification. While Snapchat's friend compass
                focused on straightforward location sharing, we aimed to make our experience more engaging and dynamic.
                Instead of just notifying users of proximity, we envisioned turning the interaction into a game. Users
                would receive challenges at select points during the day and required aligning their devices as their
                means of interaction.
                <img src="https://unitopten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Straight-Ahead-on-Snapchat.jpg">
                After expressing this furthered concept, we faced the need to answer whether to develop our concept as a
                wearable device or a smartphone application. As our group has experience in developing wearables and not
                smartphone applications, we thought the call would be a rather easy one to make.
                <img src="https://images-fe.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61X7IGCcUgS._AC_UL600_SR600,600_.jpg">
                We then got tasked with envisioning our wearable device as a fashion statement, one that users would
                need to proudly display as an integral part of their identity. To do this we decided on having the
                wearable carry itself a high pedigree of form and function. Using black components and a see-through
                exterior, much like the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, we believed our wearable would fit the bill of
                being considered a "fashion statement".
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg">
                While our device is innovative and enhances connectivity, we were then questioned if we consider it
                under the realm of cybernetics or meta-human augmentation. The group does not consider it as such nor
                that it needs to be since it is just a playful and interactive gadget, designed to augment social
                connections rather than altering the user's physical or mental capabilities. It's important to
                differentiate between technologies that enhance our social interactions and those that push the
                boundaries of human capabilities.

            <h2>Entry 2 - 5/10/2023</h2>
            <p>
                To start us off on our journey of creating this long-distance shootout game prototype, we sought two BBC
                micro:bits to function as the microcontrollers fit for processing most of our hardware and software
                needs. We chose the BBC micro:bits due to the group's previous experience in developing for them as well
                as their ease of obtaining and developing for them.
                <img src="Assets/1.jpg">
                This code is meant for two micro:bit devices and involves a simple multiplayer game using radio
                communication and compass readings. The code initializes the radio communication with a specific group
                (group 133) and sets the transmit power. It defines variables to keep track of the game state, such as
                whether the micro:bit is the "parent," the current time, the start time, the other player's score, and
                whether the game is active or if a player has been found. The code continuously reads the compass
                heading and sends this data over the radio. The two micro:bits communicate by sending and receiving
                numbers through the radio module. The game involves one micro:bit ("parent") looking for a specific
                compass angle range (240 to 300) and the other micro:bit attempting to match the inverse. Once a match
                is found, a heart is indicated on both micro:bits.
                <img src="Assets/2.PNG">
                When deploying this code, the first step of the process is to calibrate the micro:bits' compass. To
                calibrate these compasses the users must tilt the micro:bits in a way as to fill up the entire indicator
                presented on the LED array; this process is required for both the parent and non-parent micro:bit. After
                calibration is when the fun begins, now that both micro:bits are continuously sending each other the
                direction they are facing, users are now indicated when the two micro:bits are facing the opposite
                direction of each other (through the displayed sad face changing itself to a heart). This behavior is
                displayed below in the provided gif (bear in mind due to the refresh rate of the camera used to record
                such footage, the displays light up in a wave sort of formation).
                <img src="Assets/3.gif">
                This implementation is surprisingly effective, bar a few issues. The first defect of note is the rather
                poor accuracy of the two micro:bits direction sharing, this is to say that this prototype is error-prone
                for not indicating a heart when the devices are facing each other and vice versa on displaying a heart
                on both when they are in fact not. This accuracy issue likely stems due to the compass hardware present
                on the micro:bits not meeting the demands of the complexity of the task, calling for a possible external
                compass component to be wired and utilised instead. Another theory as to this inaccuracy is the volatile
                nature of the calibration process for the micro:bits' compasses and how less there is a perfectly
                replicable method of calibrating both micro:bits, there will always be a disparity between the data sent
                from one another.
                <br>
                The second defect plaguing our prototype is the lack of recorded locations on the micro:bits, as per
                this issue, the micro:bit will indicate a heart on both arrays if their faced directions are inverse of
                each other whether they are or are not parallel with one another location wise. The only possible means
                to fix such defect is deploying additional GPS components onto the micro:bits so they record and share
                their location; with some added calculations in the code this will allow for the devices to know where
                they must physically point in a 3D space as to be looking at the other device, rather than just going on
                if they're facing opposite directions of one another.

            <h2>Entry 3 - 12/10/2023</h2>
            <p>
                Our group decided to start using Arduino boards instead of micro:bits for our projects. We made this
                change because Arduino boards have shown enhanced compatibility with various components and sensors,
                making it easier for us to create this more complex project. While micro:bits are good for beginners,
                they have limitations when it comes to connecting and expanding with other hardware, which was holding
                us back.
                <img src="Assets/4.jpg">
                When we switched to Arduino, we were excited to try out a GPS module. With Arduino's compatibility and
                available libraries, it was easy to start testing what GPS technology could do. We used the specified
                library for our GPS module, which let us communicate with it and get location data. This opened up many
                possibilities, from real-time location tracking which will fix the aforementioned issues displayed by
                our micro:bit solution.
                Switching to Arduino and exploring GPS capabilities has made our projects more advanced and versatile.
                We now have the flexibility to choose from a wide range of components and sensors to reach our project
                goals. This change has been important for us, as it gives us the tools to take our projects to the next
                level.

            <h2>Entry 4 - 19/10/2023</h2>
            <p>
                For our current project, we've carefully considered the components that are essential to achieve our
                goals effectively. These components play a vital role in enhancing the project's functionality and user
                experience.
                First and foremost, the GPS module is a crucial part of our project. We've integrated a GPS module to
                record the longitude and latitude data accurately. This data serves as the foundation for location-based
                services, enabling us to track and record the precise geographical coordinates of our project. With this
                information, we can implement features like real-time location tracking, geofencing, and distance
                calculations, enhancing the overall utility of our project.
                <img src="Assets/5.jpg">
                To calculate the direction faced, we've incorporated a compass module. This component provides us with
                the ability to determine the orientation of the user or the device, adding a layer of orientation and
                navigation to our project. This information can be used in various ways, such as providing turn-by-turn
                directions or guiding the user based on their current heading. It significantly enhances the project's
                user experience and makes it more versatile for our application.
                <img src="Assets/6.jpg">
                Additionally, we've included a semicircle Glowbit equipped with RGB LEDs. This component serves as a
                visual interface to relay direction and score information to the user. The RGB LEDs allow us to display
                information using various colors and patterns, making the user experience more intuitive and engaging.
                For example, we can use specific colors to represent different directions or scores, ensuring that users
                can easily understand and interact with the project. This adds an element of gamification and visual
                feedback that enhances the overall user engagement and usability of the project.

            <p>
                Since Arduinos lack built-in radios like micro:bits, we've opted to leverage their Wi-Fi capabilities
                for seamless information exchange in our project. To make this happen, we're transitioning to using two
                "Maker1000" boards. One of these boards will act as a server Arduino, setting up a 2.4GHz network, while
                the other will serve as a client Arduino, connecting to this network. This setup allows us to establish
                a reliable communication channel between the devices, facilitating the exchange of crucial data,
                including GPS coordinates and directional information.
                <img src="Assets/8.jpg">
                The written client and server code establishes an interplay for sharing location information.The server
                code processes incoming requests, retrieves the client's location, and calculates the direction between
                the client and server, making this information accessible via a web server. The client code, running on
                one Arduino, reads data from a sensor suite that includes a GPS module and a compass. It then utilizes
                Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to the server code running on another Arduino. The client regularly sends
                its latitude and longitude data to the server through HTTP requests. This directional information is
                then displayed by both devices in their serial monitor.

            <h2>Entry 6 - 2/11/2023</h2>
            <p>
                With all the hardware now decided upon and interconnected, next in line is combining the provided
                libraries as well as adding our code so as to have the two devices working together as intended. There
                is already a loose demo that possesses close to our desired effect by relaying a directional point
                through a glowbit corresponding to the attached compass module.
                <img src="Assets/9.gif">
                The code implementation to gamify our devices remains to be implemented though, where one user must
                face the other first. With the software close to completion, next in line is manufacturing a rig to
                present our two devices in a desirable form factor. As the original concept of a watch-like wearable
                wouldn't fit the dimensions necessary for reaching a sleek and elegant form factor given the amount of
                internals, a change of plan is needed for the enclosure.
                <br>
                There are two rather promising paths we can take instead for our devices' new form factor. First of
                which is pivoting our design into that of a handheld, that with laser cut acrylic will possess ample
                room in a compartment to fit the internals whilst still possessing a handle or wrist rest for easy
                portability for the user.
                <img src="Assets/10.jpg">
                The second potential design still plays into being a wearable but instead of only having the immediate
                small footprint of the area above the rest to fit the components like the watch-like form factor would,
                a more glove-centric design (like the one below) would provide ample room for fitting components whilst
                still maintaining its fashion statement mantra as well as exceptional ease in movability.
